        <h2>About Parroting ðŸ¦œ</h2>
        Parroting is a website that helps people to improve their English
        speaking fluency and pronunciation by using a technique called
        `shadowing`.
        <h3>What is Shadowing?</h3>
        <p>
          Shadowing is a technique that is based on listening and repeating.
          Think it like you are being a parrot ðŸ¦œ. </br>If you are interested, there
          are articles about this technique on the internet. It is also called{" "}
          <i>Imitation</i> / <i>Echoing</i>, so you can use these keywords while
          searching.

        <h3>Why I Created It? What Is The Future Of Project?</h3>
        <p>
          As a developer and as a person who wants to improve English speaking
          skills, I created this hobby project for myself and I shared it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, it is okay for me. Also, there are lots of things that can
          be done about this project in the future (mobile app, more content,
          better design, better search, history, etc.) I might work on them, but
          I am not sure yet.
        </p>
